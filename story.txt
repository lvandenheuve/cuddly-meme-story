Once upon a time there was a man named Stan. He lived in a far off city and had a lot of trouble making friends. All of the other kids in his class would say, "Stan you have no friends!" and he got really sad! So that is why he wanted to change his fate.

Today would be different, Stan went to the skate park, determined to make friends. He didn't know any tricks, but he had an idea on how to wow those skaters. In his pocket were fireworks and a lighter.
