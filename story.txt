Once upon a time there was a man named Stan. He lived in a far off city and had a lot of trouble making friends. All of the other kids in his class would say, "Stan you have no friends!" and he got really sad! So that is why he wanted to change his fate.

Today would be different, Stan went to the skate park, determined to make friends. He didn't know any tricks, but he had an idea on how to wow those skaters. In his pocket were fireworks and a lighter.

He tried to draw attention. He maked up, carrying his fireworks and lighter and break into the broadcasting room of a football field.Nobody was there but there was a football game in the field. Suddenly, the screen above the field light up, it was the face of Stan! "I am Stan!"he shouted"and I am here to make friend". Everyone got shocked and the game stopped. There was a silence of death, but after a few seconds people started to screaming.

Stan knew he screwed up. He ran away, he ran all the way to his home, back to his basement. He came out once a month to collect his benefits and got occasionally brought groceries. He died aged 37 of heart failure, that was his life.

Nobody showed up to Stan's funeral, and as he watched down from heaven, he knew that he had failed at making friends. He tried as hard as he could, but unfortunately, he just couldn't pull himself together enough in order to make anyone like him. The end.
